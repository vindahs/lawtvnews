Justice Nkeonye Maha granted them bail after counsel to the 12 defendants moved applications filed to that regard and the motions were not opposed by the prosecution lawyer, Mathew Omosun.

The judge, who ordered that the defendants must produce two sureties each, directed that the two sureties for each of the defendants must be responsible citizens, and one of them must possess a landed property in Abuja with a verified certificate of occupancy.

She ruled that the second surety must be gainfully employed in Abuja, having paid his or her tax dues for three years.

She said the documents of the landed property should be submitted to the registry of the court.

The judge, who ordered that the defendants must submit their international passports to the registry, directed that all the defendants be remanded in Kuje Correctional Centre, pending the perfection of their bail terms.

The judge noted that though the prosecution did not oppose the applications, this did not preclude the court from looking at the merit of the matter based on the Supreme Court decision.

She said she, however, granted them a bail plea on the ground that the applications were unchallenged and based on the evidence before the court.

Justice Maha, however, refused to grant bail to the 11th (ASP Mohammed Yahaya), 14th (Abdullahi Adamu), and 15th (Abdullahi Usman) defendants because no bail application was before the court.

Maha, who ordered that the three defendants be remanded in Kuje Correctional Centre until the next adjourned date, fixed Jan. 17 and Jan. 18, 2022, for trial commencement.
